Issues with Program: 
- In testing it was seen that binary files that are converted to txt files create special characters that break my program. I can not identify what characters break the program because not even my terminal or text editors can display the characters in the file.
- It should also be noted that for bigger files it takes longer for my program to complete if there are limited servers available because I cap my max data transfer per packet to be 1000 bytes each. Anything larger results in increased drops or incomplete packet transmissions, and slower download speeds.
